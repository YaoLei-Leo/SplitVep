# SplitVep
The INFO/CSQ field in the Ensembl VEP annotated VCF file are separated with pipe "|", which make the annotations hard to extract by bcftools. Also, for multi-allelic variants, VEP stores the annotations in the same INFO/CSQ line with comma "," as seperatorï¼Œ which exacerbate the situation. This software is to convert the VEP annotated VCF file into bgzip compressed a TSV formatted file.

# Dependency
SplitVep requires htslib installed in the system.

# Input
A compressed VCF file with "##INFO=<ID=CSQ" in the header.

# Run the software
The software supports **Linux** system only currently.
```console
./SplitVep <input.vcf.gz> <output_prefix> <tmp_folder>
```

# Output
CSQ information is outputed in duplication mode. The different CSQ annotations for one variant will be outputed into different rows.
